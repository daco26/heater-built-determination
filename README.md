**heater-built-determination** is an android app for determination of a heaters year of construction based on its serial number.

### Why?

For some people, e.g. chimney sweeper, it is necessary to find out the year of construction of a heater or a boiler. 

But for some reason every manufacturer has developed an almost ridiculous way of hiding the year of construction in the respective equipments serial number.

### Without the app

In order to find out the year of construction of a specific device, you would have to remember all the different rules, exemplary shown below:

Manufacturer  | Example Serial number | Year of construction
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Vaillant      | **96**-12345678   | 19**96**
Stiebel-Eltron  | 003918-**69**08  | 19**94** (69+25 for whatever reason)
Geminox | 51**94**12345 | 19**94**
Wolf | **9**51**1** 0123456 | 19**91**
... | ... |...

### With the app

With the app, you don't have to remember all the rules or don't have to keep a cheat sheet with you.
The app knows how to find out the year of construction for a device of a specific manufacturer.
